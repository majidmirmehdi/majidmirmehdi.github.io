<p>
We developed a perceptual approach to generating features for use in
indexing and retrieving images from an image database. The concept is that
salient regions that immediately attract the eye are large colour regions that
usually dominate an image. Features derived from these will allow search for
images that are similar perceptually. We compute colour features and Gabor
colour texture features on regions obtained from a multiscale representation of
the image, generated by a multiband smoothing algorithm based on human
psychophysical measurements of colour appearance. The combined feature vector is
then used for indexing all salient regions of an image. When retrieving images,
those images are selected that contain more similar regions to the image the
query came from by using a multi-feedback retrieval and ranking
mechanism. Matches are found using the <em>L_2</em> metric. 
The results demonstrate that the proposed method performs very well.

A comprehensive Java-based user interface to this system is under developement. Information on this will be posted here soon.

<ul>
<li><a href="exampleI.gif">Set I</a>: This is a query on the face of the subject.

<li>
<a href="exampleII.gif">Set II</a>: This is a query on the night sky but the multifeedback system also picks up on the "white" regions of the tower. 
</ul>
