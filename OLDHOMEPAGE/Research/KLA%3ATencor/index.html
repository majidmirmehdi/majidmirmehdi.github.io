This project will develop image processing inspection algorithms to find
defects as small as 50 nm on semiconductor reticles which are used to
print the circuits on semiconductor wafers. The technique is aimed at
wafer steppers using 193 nm exposure wavelengths and Next Generation
Lithography (NGL) tools. It will find defects on reticles such as UV
induced defects, particles, electrostatic damage and crystal growth.
This technology is essential for semiconductor geometries on wafers to
go below 200 nm.

<p>
The techniques which exist today are limited to finding reticle defects
of typically 300 nm or larger, are too slow to inspect all reticles and
often cannot inspect the small geometries of today's lithography. They
will be completely unable to cope with the leading edge needs of five
years time. 

<p>
Small defects on reticles will be a serious problem for low k factor
lithography such as the 193 nm tools and an even greater problem for
subsequent generations such as SCALPEL where the use of a pellicle to
protect the reticle may not be possible. These defects will occur in
increasing numbers in the wafer fab and inspection of the reticle in the
mask shop at the time of production will not be sufficient to ensure
that the reticle remains defect free throughout its life. These future
lithography techniques will not be suitable for production environments
unless there is a technique available to verify that the reticle has not
degraded. As the industry moves to 300 mm wafers with a large number of
single die reticles, a single defect on a reticle will cause
catastrophic yield loss. It will be necessary to inspect reticles every
time they are used to find even the smallest defects. The wafer fab will
thus need a very fast and sensitive reticle inspection technique.

<p>
<!-- KLA-Tencor's research has identified a technical solution to this problem. However it requires each circuit pattern to be compared against a reference in order to find defects. This is acceptable for reticles with more than one die, but does not address the needs of the most advanced circuits which have only one die per reticle.-->

<p>
The aim of this research project is to develop algorithms which will
find defects in the image of the circuit pattern without the need for a
reference image. By using the device design rules and modelling the
imaging process, it is possible to transform the image and separate the
circuit pattern from the defects. This technique does not exist in any
commercially available equipment.

<p>
The project is financially supported through an EPSRC CASE collaboration with
<a href="http://www.kla-tencor.com/">KLA-Tencor</a> which is the world leader 
in yield management and process control
solutions for semiconductor manufacturing and related industries. An S&P
500 company, KLA-Tencor has an annual turnover of over $1b and over
4,000 employees worldwide. Company headquarters are located in San Jose,
California, with offices worldwide. The company developed its first
image processing based, automated inspection system for photomasks 20
years ago.
<p>
<!--KLA-Tencor have a UK based Research facility which is currently developing new image processing technology for semiconductor inspection to be manufactured in the UK. There are currently 7 research engineers (4 with PhDs) working in this field at the KLA-Tencor UK Development Centre. The facility has extensive image processing computing equipment and a clean room equipped with in house developed laser based optical instrumentation for capturing images of new generation semiconductor devices.-->
