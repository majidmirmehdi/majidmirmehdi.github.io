A multiscale representation of the texture image, generated by a
multiband smoothing algorithm based on human psychophysical measurements of
colour appearance is used as the input. Initial segmentation is achieved by
applying a clustering algorithm to the image at the coarsest level of
smoothing. The segmented clusters are then restructured in order to isolate <em>
core clusters</em>, i.e. patches in which the pixels are definitely associated with
the same region. The image pixels representing the core clusters are used to
form 3D colour histograms which are then used for probabilistic assignment of
all other pixels to the core clusters to form larger clusters and categorise the
rest of the image.  The process of  setting up
colour histograms and probabilistic reassignment of the pixels to the clusters
is then propagated through finer levels of smoothing until a full segmentation is
achieved at the highest level of resolution.
