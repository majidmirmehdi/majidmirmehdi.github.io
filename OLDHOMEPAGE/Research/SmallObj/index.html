<p>
There are many problems in which very small objects undergoing motion must be detected and then tracked. Examples may be found in the medical imaging, astronomical image processing, remote sensing, and military vision fields. For example, one of the most difficult goals of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) is to spot incoming objects at long range, where the motion seems small and the SNR is poor,  and the system must be able to track such targets long enough to identify whether the  object is a friend or foe. 

<p>
We are interested in locating long-range moving objects in FLIR images where the
object may only be a few pixels in size and has low contrast with its
background. Simple methods of image differencing are therefore not
appropriate. A more robust algorithm is needed that is fairly simple to compute,
has the potential to run in real-time, and is relatively immune to noise. It must
be emphasised that template matching methods are also inappropriate for this 
problem as targets may be very small, and consequently have virtually no structure
associated with them.
<p>

We exploit useful properties of wavelet filters to provide a method for 
object detection even when the object size is as small as 6 pixels. We anticipate 
that the object size and motion will change during the sequence. We have
developed a high order prediction mechanism for use with a Kalman filter
 to determine regions of interest which reduces the search space for generating
hypothesised tracks. The method generates a hypothesis tree for the motion of
target objects across the image sequence which is pruned using a <em> measure of
interest</em> operator based upon the Kalman filter error estimates.
<p>

The MPEG movies below demonstrate the detection and tracking of mutiple small 
objects (a fighter jet and a number of cars). The tracking also handles occlusion 
and overlapping of the moving objects. More details may be found in

 Below we see the original FLIR image sequence taken from a stationary camera 
 looking over a valley. This scene contains multiple moving objects that are not 
 immediately obvious. The principal object of interest is a small plane. It 
 commences its path at (column,row) location = (101,293) in frame 1. It continues 
 to move more or less horizontally from right to left for about 10 frames until
 about frames 8-15 where it undertakes a turning manoeuvre roughly around 
 (57,285). By frame 19 the plane starts its principal run from this point in an 
 essentially horizontal trajectory from left to right. During this phase, the plane
 
 is also approaching the camera and consequently becomes both larger as well as 
 appears to be travelling faster. By frame 49 a final upward sweep is made at rough
ly 
 (301,287), and by frame 58 it is flying almost entirely vertically along column 36
5.
 By this stage clear structural details of the plane are visible. We can see the ch
anges
 in pose arising from the plane's manoeuvre. 
 <p>

 <p>
 However, this is not all that is happening. The faint line running from (0,408)->(
512,443)
 is actually a road and throughout the sequence vehicles can be found moving along 
it. They are 
 essentially represented by small "hotspots" associated with the engine or headligh
ts. These 
 hotspots, however, have insufficient contrast with their 
 surroundings to be extracted with much reliability by a standard differencing meth
od.

In the next sequence we show the results of the tracking algorithm superimposed on 
the 
images. Multiple targets are 
detected by correlating motion information over several consecutive frames.  
The tracked objects are marked white and are determined by evaluating the correlati
on
with greylevel values.        
<p>
<p> 
The plane is detected in frames 2 and 3 in its original right to left motion. It is
 lost 
during the turning manoeuvre since there is little relative motion during this phas
e. 
The plane is detected again  in frame 22 on its principal run from left to right, a
fter 
which it is tracked succesfully to the end of the sequence. The object still has 
very low SNR when it is first detected illustrating the robustness of the method.
Towards the end of the 
sequence the shape of the plane is well represented by the white marking pixels, an
d 
consequently this allows for better determination of pose.   
<p>
<p>
 There are between 2-6 moving objects on the road at any one time, of which only a 
couple 
 are usually extractable. The objects, while travelling along the road, are obscure
d 
 by hedges and trees, and so establishing consistent motion is made 
 more difficult. A particularly interesting sequence occurs between frames 5-12 in 
the 
 area (23-79,400-430), where two cars approach, pass each other (in frame 9) and 
 continue on.

 Once the object is detected, it must be recognised. This may prove 
difficult at long range as the object will comprise a few pixels only with almost
no visible structural information. One approach would be to zoom in on the object 
given adaptable optical capability. Assuming adaptive optics is available, how can 
we determine the best zoom to give optimal magnification? This issue is considered
