<p>
There are many problems in which very small objects undergoing motion must be detected and then tracked. Examples may be found in the medical imaging, astronomical image processing, remote sensing, and military vision fields. For example, one of the most difficult goals of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) is to spot incoming objects at long range, where the motion seems small and the SNR is poor,  and the system must be able to track such targets long enough to identify whether the  object is a friend or foe. 

<p>
We are interested in locating long-range moving objects in FLIR images where the
object may only be a few pixels in size and has low contrast with its
background. Simple methods of image differencing are therefore not
appropriate. A more robust algorithm is needed that is fairly simple to compute,
has the potential to run in real-time, and is relatively immune to noise. It must
be emphasised that template matching methods are also inappropriate for this 
problem as targets may be very small, and consequently have virtually no structure
associated with them.
<p>

We exploit useful properties of wavelet filters to provide a method for 
object detection even when the object size is as small as 6 pixels. We anticipate 
that the object size and motion will change during the sequence. We have
developed a high order prediction mechanism for use with a Kalman filter
 to determine regions of interest which reduces the search space for generating
hypothesised tracks. The method generates a hypothesis tree for the motion of
target objects across the image sequence which is pruned using a <em> measure of
interest</em> operator based upon the Kalman filter error estimates.
<p>
The MPEG movies below demonstrate the detection and tracking of mutiple small 
objects (a fighter jet and a number of cars). The tracking also handles occlusion 
and overlapping of the moving objects. More details may be found in

 Once the object is detected, it must be recognised. This may prove 
difficult at long range as the object will comprise a few pixels only with almost
no visible structural information. One approach would be to zoom in on the object 
given adaptable optical capability. Assuming adaptive optics is available, how can 
we determine the best zoom to give optimal magnification? This issue is considered 
in:
